# 3PC_Protocol-with-Improvements
Simulation of 3 Phase Commit protocol with improvisation for higher priority tasks

We have made a distributed system calculator to visualize the improved approach to 3PC algorithm which we came up with. 
Here Transaction manager is our server node which distributes the workload among the Client Nodes which are supposed to be Participating Nodes.

Future Aim :- Multithreading and achieve live connection between all 3 Slave nodes
