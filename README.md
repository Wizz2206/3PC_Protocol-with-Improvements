# 3PC_Protocol-with-Improvements
Simulation of 3 Phase Commit protocol with improvisation for higher priority tasks

I have made a distributed system calculator to visualize the improved approach to 3PC algorithm which I came up with.
Here Transaction manager is our server node which distributes the workload among the Client Nodes which are supposed to be Participating Nodes.<br>

Directions to run :-<br>
-> Run the server file and input the number of client nodes as per requirement<br>
-> Run the client file with inline argument for the serial number of client (for the port numbers)<br>

Future Aim :- Multithreading and achieve live connection betIen all 3 Slave nodes
