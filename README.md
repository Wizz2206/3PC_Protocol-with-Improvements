# 3PC_Protocol-with-Improvements
Simulation of 3 Phase Commit protocol with improvisation for higher priority tasks

We have made a distributed system calculator to visualize the improved approach to 3PC algorithm which we came up with.
Here Transaction manager is our server node which distributes the workload among the Client Nodes which are supposed to be Participating Nodes.<br>

Directions to run :-<br>
-> Run the server file and input the number of client nodes as per requirement<br>
-> Run the client file with inline argument for the serial number of client (for the port numbers)<br>

Future Aim :- Multithreading and achieve live connection between all 3 Slave nodes
